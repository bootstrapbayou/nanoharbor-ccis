## About This School

The **Cloud Computing & Infrastructure School (CCI)** focuses on Azure-based cloud solutions, guiding learners through infrastructure setup, process automation, and secure cloud practices. Labs within this school are intended to:

- Provide foundational knowledge in **Azure virtual networks**, **virtual machines**, and **storage solutions**.
- Empower learners to use **Azure Automation**, **ARM templates**, and **Azure CLI** to streamline cloud operations.
- Strengthen understanding of **identity management**, **network security**, and **compliance**.

These labs serve as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical application, preparing you for real-world scenarios in cloud infrastructure management.
